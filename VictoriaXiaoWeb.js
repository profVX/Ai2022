<h1>Artificial Intelligent in Films Throughout the Years</h1>

<h3>Introduction :)</h3>
<p>The discussion of Artificial Intelligence and its development has been portrayed in many
mediums such as literature, cartoons and films. In recent years, such topic has been increasingly
explored in cinematography. However, the public has the tendency of discriminating the
unknown. Hence, artificial intelligence has been visualized by majority of the public as
intimidating and dangerous since the publication of Turing’s “Computing Machinery and
Intelligence”. Yet, as technology grows and artificial intelligence develops, the publics’ attitude
towards AI technology has varied. Although in early films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey
(1968) and The Matrix (1999), AI was mainly portrayed as potential danger and a threat to
human existence, a significant transformation of such negative attitude can be seen in recent
films such as Her (2013) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017). Noticing that the time span of these
films is almost half a century. By now, basic service AI technology is almost accessible to most
of the public. Therefore, the question, whether the development of artificial intelligence is
absolutely doomed, has been reconsidered. This essay will analysis the transformation of
artificial intelligence representation through exploring the depiction of varied human interactions
with artificial intelligence in the following five films: 2001: <b>A Space Odyssey (1968), The Blade
Runner (1982), The Matrix (1999), Her (2017), and The Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</b>.
